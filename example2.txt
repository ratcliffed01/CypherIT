Write a program to reassemble a given set of text fragments into their original sequence. For this challenge your program should have a
 main method accepting one argument - the path to a well- formed UTF-8 encoded text file. Each line in the file represents a test
 case of the main functionality of your program: read it, process it and println to the console the corresponding defragmented output.
Each line contains text fragments separated by a semicolon, ";". You can assume that every fragment has length at least 2.
